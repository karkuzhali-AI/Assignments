        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "In Python, functions and methods are both callable entities, but they differ in their context and usage. Here’s a breakdown of the key differences:\n",
        "1. Definition:\n",
        "Function: A function is defined using the def keyword and can exist independently, not necessarily associated with a particular object or class.\n",
        "def my_function():\n",
        "    print(\"This is a function.\")\n",
        "Method: A method is a function that is associated with an object or a class. In Python, methods are defined inside classes.\n",
        "Class MyClass:\n",
        "    def my_method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"This is a method.\"\n",
        "2. Calling Context:\n",
        "Function: A function can be called on its own, without requiring any object.\n",
        "my_function()\n",
        "Method: A method is called on an instance of a class (or the class itself, in the case of class methods).\n",
        "obj = MyClass()\n",
        "obj.my_method()  # Method is called on the object instance.\n",
        "3.Implicit Argument:\n",
        "Function: Functions do not take any special implicit arguments (unless explicitly defined).\n",
        "Method: Instance methods automatically take the instance of the class (commonly self) as their first argument. This allows methods to access and modify the object's attributes.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    def my_method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Method called on instance:\", self)\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = MyClass()\n",
        "obj.my_method()  # `self` is passed implicitly\n",
        "4.Types:\n",
        "Function: A regular Python function is of type function.\n",
        "Method: A method is an instance of the class it is associated with. Python recognizes it as either bound method (if called on an object) or unbound method (in older Python versions, if accessed via the class).\n",
        "5.Binding:\n",
        "Function: A function is not bound to any object.\n",
        "Method: A method is bound to an instance (in the case of instance methods) or the class itself (in the case of class or static methods).\n",
        "Types of Methods:\n",
        "Instance Method: A method that operates on the object (instance) of the class.\n",
        "Class Method: A method bound to the class rather than the instance, using @classmethod and taking cls as its first argument.\n",
        "Static Method: A method that doesn’t operate on the class or its instances, marked with @staticmethod and doesn’t take self or cls.\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "A function is an independent piece of code that performs a task and can be used anywhere.\n",
        "A method is a function that is part of a class and typically works with the class's instances or the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "In Python, parameters and arguments refer to different parts of function definitions and function calls. These terms are related but distinct. Here's a detailed breakdown of each concept:\n",
        ". Parameters:\n",
        "Definition: Parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They define the input that the function expects to receive. Essentially, they act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function during execution.\n",
        "Location: In the function definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name): # 'name' is a parameter\n",
        " print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "2.Arguments:\n",
        "Definition: Arguments are the actual values provided to the function when it is called. They correspond to the function's parameters and supply the data that the function will operate on.\n",
        "Location: In the function cal\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\") # 'Alice' is an argument passed to the 'name' parameter\n",
        "Types of Parameters and Arguments\n",
        "Python offers several ways to define parameters and pass arguments, providing flexibility in function design.\n",
        "1. Positional Arguments:\n",
        "These are arguments that are passed to the function in the same order as the parameters are defined.\n",
        "Example\n",
        "def add(a, b): return a + b\n",
        "result = add(5, 3) # Positional arguments: 5 -> a, 3 -> b\n",
        "Keyword Arguments:\n",
        "Arguments can also be passed by explicitly specifying the parameter name. This allows you to pass arguments in any order.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "def introduce(name, age):\n",
        "    print(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "introduce(age=25, name=\"John\")  # Keyword arguments\n",
        "3. Default Parameters:\n",
        "Parameters can have default values, which will be used if no argument is passed for them.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "greet()          # Output: Hello, Guest!\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\")   # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "4. Variable-Length Arguments:\n",
        "Python allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments.\n",
        "Arbitrary Positional Arguments (*args): These allow a function to accept any number of positional arguments, which are received as a tuple.\n",
        "oExample:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "def sum_all(*args):\n",
        "    return sum(args)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\n",
        "print(sum_all(4, 5))     # Output: 9\n",
        "Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (**kwargs): These allow a function to accept any number of keyword arguments, which are received as a dictionary.\n",
        "oExample:\n",
        "python\n",
        "def display_info(**kwargs):\n",
        "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
        "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "display_info(name=\"Alice\", age=30, city=\"New York\")\n",
        "5. Positional-Only and Keyword-Only Parameters:\n",
        "Python 3.8 introduced positional-only and keyword-only arguments for more control over function calls.\n",
        "Positional-Only Parameters (/): Parameters that can only be passed as positional arguments.\n",
        "oExample:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "def func(x, /, y):\n",
        "    return x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "func(1, 2)   # Valid\n",
        "func(x=1, y=2)  # Invalid, 'x' must be positional\n",
        "Keyword-Only Parameters (*): Parameters that can only be passed as keyword arguments.\n",
        "oExample:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "def func(a, *, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "func(1, b=2)  # Valid\n",
        "func(1, 2)    # Invalid, 'b' must be keyword-only\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "Parameters: Variables listed in a function definition to specify what kind of input it expects.\n",
        "Arguments: Values provided to the function when it is called.\n",
        "Python supports positional arguments, keyword arguments, default values, and variable-length arguments to offer flexibility in how functions are defined and called.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "In Python, functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. Python provides several ways to define and call functions, offering flexibility in their usage. Here's an overview of different ways to define and call functions in Python:\n",
        "1. Defining a Function in Python\n",
        "Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses ( ), and a colon :. Any code that belongs to the function is indented.\n",
        "def function_name(): print(\"Hello from the function!\")\n",
        "2. Calling the function:\n",
        "function_name() # Output: Hello from the function!\n",
        "2. Different Ways to Define Functions.\n",
        "3. Different Ways to Call Functions in Python\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "You can define functions in Python with parameters, return values, default parameters, or using variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
        "Functions can also be defined anonymously using lambda functions.\n",
        "Functions can be called using positional arguments, keyword arguments, or a mix of both.\n",
        "Python also supports unpacking arguments from lists, tuples, and dictionaries using * and **.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "The return statement in a Python function is used to:\n",
        "1.Exit the function: The return statement terminates the function's execution and transfers control back to the point where the function was called. If return is reached, the function stops executing any further code.\n",
        "2.Send a value back to the caller: It allows a function to pass back data (the return value) to the caller. This return value can be used by the code that called the function for further operations. If no value is specified, the function returns None by default.\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "def function_name(parameters):\n",
        " # Function body return value\n",
        "# value is optional\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "Iterable\n",
        "An iterable is any Python object that can return its elements one at a time. Examples of iterables include lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings.\n",
        "An object is considered iterable if it implements the __iter__() method or the __getitem__() method (for objects like lists).\n",
        "Iterables can be looped over with a for loop, but they do not necessarily \"remember\" where they are in the iteration.\n",
        "# List (iterable) my_list = [1, 2, 3] # String (iterable) my_string = \"hello\" # Both can be iterated over for item in my_list: print(item) for char in my_string: print(char)\n",
        "7.What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "Generators in Python are a special kind of iterator that allow you to iterate over data lazily (one item at a time), making them highly efficient for tasks that involve large datasets or long-running processes. They are defined using a function with the yield keyword instead of return.\n",
        "Memory Efficiency\n",
        "Generators in Python are a special kind of iterator that allow you to iterate over data lazily (one item at a time), making them highly efficient for tasks that involve large datasets or long-running processes. They are defined using a function with the yield keyword instead of return.\n",
        "# Generator that produces a sequence of numbers lazily def count_up_to(n): count = 1 while count <= n: yield count count += 1 # Memory-efficient, doesn't create the entire sequence in memory for number in count_up_to(1000000): print(number)\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "A lambda function in Python is an anonymous, inline function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike a regular function, which is defined using the def keyword, a lambda function can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The result of the expression is automatically returned.\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y print(add(2, 3)) # Output: 5\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "Anonymous: It doesn't require a name (though you can assign it to a variable as shown above).\n",
        "Inline: It's written in a single line.\n",
        "Single Expression: The body of a lambda function is limited to one expression, which is evaluated and returned.\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and returns an iterator (a map object) with the results. It's particularly useful when you need to transform a collection of data by applying a function to every element.\n",
        "map(function, iterable[, iterable2, iterable3, ...])\n",
        "A\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "In Python, map(), reduce(), and filter() are built-in functions that work with iterables. They help perform transformations and reductions efficiently, but each serves a distinct purpose:\n",
        "1.Map()\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "result = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)  # Doubles each number\n",
        "print(list(result))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
        "2.reduce()\n",
        "from functools import reduce\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)  # Sums all the numbers\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 10\n",
        "3.filter()\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "result = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)  # Filters out odd numbers\n",
        "print(list(result))  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
        "4.\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "map() transforms all elements of an iterable by applying a function.\n",
        "reduce() aggregates all elements into a single result.\n",
        "filter() extracts elements that meet a condition, as specified by a function returning True or False."
